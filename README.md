Unit 1 Project

Welcome to my Unit 1 project!

I would like to include a carousel featuring 3 photos, 1 of myself, 1 of something I love and 1 with someone I love.

I will create 3 index pages that extend to reveal it's contents. These indexes will include an "about me", "experience", and a simple game or generator. 

In the footing on my project, I will attach link for my LinkedIn and GitHub as well as a link directed to my email address. 

@media query and jQuery 

For my third jQuery intialization, I will include a Modal popup with an extension of my resume. Which will be laid out differently than the in depth experience tab which will touch base on my service industry and art industry experience over the years.

I would like to design the project in the style of either pixle "kawaii" theme or studio ghibli inspired with greenery and soft landscapes.
